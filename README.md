Memory Governance for Continual Learning Systems

MemorySafe is a memory governance framework for continual learning systems, designed to prevent safety-critical information from being forgotten under memory and compute constraints.

Rather than modifying how models learn, MemorySafe governs what they retain.

It operates as a policy-level decision layer for memory, acting as an intelligent governor that disciplines data retention independently of the learning algorithm.

Use cases include medical AI, edge systems, fraud detection, robotics, and privacy-aware AI.
