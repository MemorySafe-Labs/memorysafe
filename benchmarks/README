# MemorySafe Benchmarks

This folder contains validation scripts and result summaries for evaluating the MemorySafe policy across heterogeneous continual learning benchmarks.

The goal of these experiments is to test **generalization of the memory governance policy** under increasing task complexity and data modality shifts.


## 🚀 Public Demo (Colab)

Run the MemorySafe public demo comparing MemorySafe-Taste vs FIFO:

## Benchmarks Included

The same unchanged MemorySafe policy was evaluated on:

- MNIST  
- Fashion-MNIST  
- CIFAR-10  
- CIFAR-100  
- Omniglot  
- Permuted MNIST  
- PneumoniaMNIST (MedMNIST)

No dataset-specific tuning was applied.

## Metrics

We report:

- **Task-0 Protection**  
  Accuracy on the first task after learning all subsequent tasks.

- **Rare-Class Recall**  
  Recall on low-frequency or safety-critical classes.

- **Overall Accuracy**  
  Accuracy across all seen classes.

## Summary Results

| Dataset        | Task-0 Protection | Rare Recall |
|----------------|------------------:|------------:|
| MNIST          | 100%              | N/A         |
| Fashion-MNIST  | 100%              | N/A         |
| CIFAR-10       | 100%              | N/A         |
| CIFAR-100      | 100%              | N/A         |
| Omniglot       | 100%              | N/A         |
| Permuted MNIST | 100%              | N/A         |
| PneumoniaMNIST | –                 | 0.917       |

These results indicate zero-shot generalization of a memory allocation policy across tasks, modalities, and difficulty regimes.

## Reproducibility

Each benchmark includes:

- fixed random seeds  
- identical policy parameters  
- identical memory capacity  

Scripts are designed to run on CPU or GPU.

This folder serves as the experimental evidence for claims reported in the MemorySafe documentation and website.
